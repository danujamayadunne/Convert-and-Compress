                            When it comes to optimizing images for the web, choosing the right format can make a huge difference in terms of file size, quality, and usability. In this post, we&apos;ll explore the three most commonly used image formats: <strong>JPEG</strong>, <strong>PNG</strong>, and <strong>GIF</strong>. We&apos;ll help you understand their differences and guide you on when to use each format. Plus, we&apos;ll show you how to easily convert between these formats for better web performance.

                            JPEG: Perfect for Photographs
                        </h3>

                        <p className="mb-6">
                            JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is the go-to format for photographs and images with lots of color gradients. It uses lossy compression, meaning some image quality is sacrificed to reduce file size. This makes JPEGs ideal for web usage where smaller file sizes are essential for fast page loading times. Use <strong>JPEG</strong> when you need high-quality photographs that don&apos;t require transparency or crisp edges.
                        </p>

                            PNG: Great for Graphics and Transparency
                        </h3>

                        <p className="mb-6">
                            PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is a lossless format, which means it retains all image quality. This makes it perfect for images with sharp edges or graphics like logos, icons, and text. PNG also supports transparency, allowing for clean backgrounds. While PNGs tend to have larger file sizes compared to JPEGs, the quality is unbeatable, especially when transparency is needed. Use <strong>PNG</strong> for graphics, logos, and images that require high detail and transparency.
                        </p>

                            GIF: Ideal for Animations
                        </h3>

                        <p className="mb-6">
                            GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) is best known for its ability to support animations. It&apos;s a lossless format that uses indexed color, which means it&apos;s limited to 256 colors. GIFs are perfect for small animations, such as memes, animated icons, or simple graphics. However, GIFs are not ideal for photos or images with complex colors, as they may appear pixelated. Use <strong>GIF</strong> when you need simple animated graphics or when file size is more important than image detail.

                            <li><strong>GIF:</strong> Use for simple animations, logos with animation, or low-complexity graphics that don&apos;t require more than 256 colors.</li>
